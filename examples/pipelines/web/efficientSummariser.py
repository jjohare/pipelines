"""
Efficient Web Summary Pipeline for OpenWebUI and Pipelines

This pipeline script integrates with OpenWebUI and Pipelines to extract URLs from unstructured text
and generate summaries of web pages using the OpenAI API.

Key features:
- URL extraction from unstructured text using regex
- Efficient web scraping using Playwright
- Content filtering to reduce irrelevant data
- Batched processing of URLs
- Topic highlighting in summaries
- Customizable summary length and batch size
- Model selection from available OpenAI models

Usage:
1. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY in the Valves configuration.
2. Set the TOPICS (comma-separated) in the Valves configuration.
3. Select the desired model from the dropdown in the Valves configuration.
4. Optionally adjust MAX_TOKENS and BATCH_SIZE in the Valves configuration.
5. Input unstructured text containing URLs in the user message.
6. The pipeline will extract URLs, scrape the web pages, and generate summaries.
